.SH DESCRIPTION \"{{{
.SS "Introduction" \"{{{
.B Msxascii
is a detokenizer for Microsoft Basic for Atari
400/800/600XL/800XL/1200XL/65XE/130XE program files. Atari 8-bit
microcomputers were built around 6502C microprocessors with
additional specialized circuits to handle sound	and graphics. They
had a Basic interpreter on cartridge (400/800 models) or in ROM (all
the other) that differed from Microsoft BASIC in string
handling and file access in particular.
A Basic interpreter on ROM cartridge and on
floppy disk was developed for these computers by Microsoft. To save space in
computer memory and on floppy disks, the Basic keywords were 
replaced by single byte or two-byte tokens. \fBamsbascii\fP reads 
an MSX-Basic file saved in tokenized format and allows to list 
the Basic program and save it in ASCII format. The program may then
be used with a Unix traditional Basic interpreter such as
\fBbwbasic(1)\fP,\fPbas(1)\fP or \fBblassic(1)\fP.

.SS "Commands" \"{{{
 Once \fBamsbascii\fP has been started, it expects to receive commands 
as a Basic interpreter in direct mode.
. IP "[\fB auto \fP]"   \"{{{
Starts automatic line numbering.
.\"}}} 
.IP "[\fB credits \fP]"  \"{{{
Prints credits.
.\"}}} 
.IP "[\fB help \fP]" \"{{{ 
Prints some help messages.
.\"}}} 
.IP "[\fB list \fP]" \"{{{ 
Lists a program previously loaded in memory on standard output. 
\fB list xx-yy \fP xx-yy will list only the lines from xx to yy. 
\fB list xx-yy,filename\fP  will list only the lines from xx to yy and
write them to the file filename instead of writing to stdout. 
.\"}}} 
.IP "[\fB load \fP]" \"{{{ 
loads a program in memory. a filename enclosed in double quotes must be provided as argument. The program loaded in memory will be erased. 
.\"}}} 
.IP "[\fB new \fP]" \"{{{ 
erases the program currently in memory.  
.\"}}}  
.IP "[\fB run \fP]" \"{{{

.SH HISTORY \"{{{
The original program \fBgwbasic(1)\fP written by Christian A. Ratliff
was a detokenizer for GW-Basic, the IBM-PC Basic interpreter. The
present program has been modified (different tokens, BCD arithmetic)
by Edmond Orignac to detokenize Microsoft BASIC for 8-bit Atari. The
tokens were found by Bruce Watson.
