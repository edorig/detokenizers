.SH DESCRIPTION \"{{{
.SS "Introduction" \"{{{
.B Cpmascii
is a detokenizer for Microsoft Basic for CP/M-80 program files. 
CP/M  was a an operating system for Intel 8080/8085 and Zilog Z80 
based microcomputers developped by Digital Research at the end of the
1980s. A Basic interpreter was developed for the CP/M operating system 
by Microsoft. For reasons of compatibility across the different hardware, 
this interpreter has no graphical instructions. 
To save space incomputer memory and on floppy disks, 
the Basic keywords were replaced by single byte or two-byte tokens. 
\fBcpmascii\fP reads 
an Microsoft Basic file saved in tokenized format and allows to list 
the Basic program and save it in ASCII format. The program may then
be used with a Unix traditional Basic interpreter such as
\fBbwbasic(1)\fP,\fPbas(1)\fP or \fBblassic(1)\fP.

 Once \fBcpmascii\fP has been started, it expects to receive commands 
as a Basic interpreter in direct mode.

.IP "[\fB list \fP]" \"{{{ 
Lists a program previously loaded in memory on standard output. 
\fB list xx-yy \fP xx-yy will list only the lines from xx to yy. 
\fB list xx-yy,filename\fP  will list only the lines from xx to yy and
write them to the file filename instead of writing to stdout. The file
name should not be placed between quotes.

.SH HISTORY \"{{{
The original program \fBgwbasic(1)\fP written by Christian Ractliff
was a detokenizer for GW-Basic, the IBM-PC Basic interpreter. The
present program has been modified 
by Edmond Orignac to detokenize Microsoft Basic for CP/M-80.
