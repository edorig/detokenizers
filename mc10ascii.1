.SH DESCRIPTION \"{{{
.SS "Introduction" \"{{{
.B mc10ascii
is a detokenizer for Microsoft Basic for Tandy MC10 and Matra Alice program
files. Matra Alice and Tandy MC-10 8-bit
microcomputers were built around Motorola 6803 microprocessors. The
Matra Alice were used in French middle and high schools in the 1980s following
the \fI Informatique pour Tous \fR plan of 1985. To save space in
computer memory and on tapes or floppy disks, the Basic keywords were 
replaced by single byte or two-byte tokens. \fBmc10ascii\fP reads 
on stanfard input a  Basic file saved in tokenized format and outputs  
the Basic program in ASCII format on standard output. The program may then
be used with a Unix traditional Basic interpreter such as
\fBbwbasic(1)\fP,\fPbas(1)\fP or \fBblassic(1)\fP.

.SH HISTORY \"{{{
The program \fBgwbasic\fP written by Christian A. Ratliff
was a detokenizer for GW-Basic, the IBM-PC Basic interpreter. The
present program is inspired by it, but given the much simpler
structure of tokenized Basic on the Tandy and Matra computers  it is written as a straightforward Unix filter.
