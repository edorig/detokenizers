.SH DESCRIPTION \"{{{
.SS "Introduction" \"{{{
.B zba2ascii
is a detokenizer for Zedcor ZBasic for Apple II program
files.Zedcor initially offered ZBasic on the TRS-80 and later ported
it to Apple II, CP/M, MSDOS and Macintosh. To save space in
computer memory and on tapes or floppy disks, the ZBasic keywords were 
replaced by single byte tokens. The line format was 2 bytes to encode
the line number, 1 byte to encode the line length, followed by tokens
and text of the line. A special token (0xff) was used to indicate that
the following two bytes were a line number following a GOTO or GOSUB
instruction. The last line of the program was numbered 65535 and
contained only the instruction END. \fBzba2ascii\fP reads 
on stanfard input a  ZBasic file saved in tokenized format and outputs  
the program in ASCII format on standard output. After some adaptation,
the program may 
be used with a Unix traditional Basic interpreter such as
\fBbwbasic(1)\fP,\fPbas(1)\fP or \fBblassic(1)\fP.

.SH LIMITATIONS\"{{{
The tokens recognized by the program correspond only to a subset of
the keywords of ZBasic for Apple II. They were deduced from
examination of a few sample tokenized program. Tokens for which a
keyword has not been identified will appear as a $ sign followed by an
hexadecimal number. Knowing the list of keywords of Zbasic and their
syntax may allow identification of the missing tokens.
